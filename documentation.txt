# Adaptive Learning Project

A personalized learning system powered by artificial intelligence. It delivers customized exercises to students based on their learning profile, mastery levels, question style preferences, and predictions from a Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) model.

## 🔍 What the Project Does
- Tracks student performance over time
- Builds a dynamic state vector for each student
- Trains a reinforcement learning agent to choose the next best exercise
- Aims to maximize learning utility using: success probability × difficulty level
